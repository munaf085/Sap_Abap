## 🎯 **Key Technical Achievements**

### **1. Enterprise Integration Patterns**
```abap
" Circuit Breaker Pattern Implementation
IF circuit_breaker->is_call_allowed( ) = abap_true.
  " Make API call
  ls_response = mo_integration_fw->call_api( ls_request ).
  circuit_breaker->record_success( ).
ELSE.
  " Circuit is open - fail fast
  RAISE EXCEPTION TYPE cx_integration_error.
ENDIF.
```

### **2. Advanced Error Handling**
```abap
TRY.
    " Complex business operation
    ls_result = process_order( is_context ).
  CATCH cx_validation_error INTO DATA(lx_validation).
    handle_validation_error( lx_validation ).
  CATCH cx_credit_check_error INTO DATA(lx_credit).
    handle_credit_error( lx_credit ).
  CATCH cx_integration_error INTO DATA(lx_integration).
    handle_integration_error( lx_integration ).
ENDTRY.
```

### **3. Performance Optimization**
```abap
" Parallel processing implementation
IF mv_parallel_processing = abap_true.
  LOOP AT lt_orders INTO ls_order.
    CALL FUNCTION 'Z_PROCESS_ORDER_RFC'
      STARTING NEW TASK lv_task_name
      DESTINATION IN GROUP 'PARALLEL_GROUP'
      EXPORTING is_order = ls_order.
  ENDLOOP.
ENDIF.
```

### **4. Modern ABAP Techniques**
```abap
" Value constructor with conditional logic
DATA(lt_filtered_orders) = VALUE order_table(
  FOR ls_order IN lt_all_orders
  WHERE ( ls_order-status = 'ACTIVE' AND 
          ls_order-amount > 1000 )
  ( ls_order ) ).
```
