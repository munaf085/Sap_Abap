## üìã **Quick Reference**

### **üöÄ Emergency Debug Commands**
| **Action** | **Command** | **Use Case** |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Start Debug** | `/h` in command field | Quick debug mode |
| **Hard Breakpoint** | `BREAK-POINT.` | Stop execution immediately |
| **User Breakpoint** | `BREAK sy-uname.` | Debug for specific user only |
| **Continue** | **F8** | Resume execution |
| **Step Through** | **F5** | Execute line by line |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **1. Breakpoint Strategies**

### **Hard-Coded Breakpoints**
```abap
" Unconditional breakpoint
BREAK-POINT.

" Conditional breakpoint
IF lv_debug_flag = 'X'.
  BREAK-POINT.
ENDIF.

" User-specific breakpoint
BREAK sy-uname.  " Only breaks for current user

" Environment-specific debugging
IF sy-mandt = '100'.  " Only in development client
  BREAK-POINT.
ENDIF.
```

### **External Breakpoints (SE80/ADT)**
- **Session Breakpoints**: Valid for current session only
- **User Breakpoints**: Persistent for specific user
- **HTTP Breakpoints**: For web-based applications
- **External RFC Breakpoints**: For remote function calls

#### **Setting External Breakpoints**
```abap
" In SE80:
" 1. Open program/class
" 2. Double-click line number to set breakpoint
" 3. Use Ctrl+Shift+F12 to manage breakpoints

" In ADT (Eclipse):
" 1. Double-click left margin
" 2. Right-click for conditional breakpoints
" 3. Use Breakpoints view to manage
```

### **Advanced Breakpoint Types**
```abap
" Watchpoint - breaks when variable changes
" Set in debugger: Watchpoints tab

" Method breakpoint - breaks when method is called
" Set in debugger: Method breakpoints

" Exception breakpoint - breaks on specific exceptions
" Set in debugger: Exception breakpoints
```

---

## üîç **2. Debugging Different Scenarios**

### **Database Operations**
```abap
" Debug SELECT statements
SELECT single * FROM mara INTO DATA(ls_material)
  WHERE matnr = p_matnr.

BREAK-POINT.  " Check sy-subrc and ls_material content

" Check database performance
" 1. Set breakpoint before SELECT
" 2. Use ST05 (SQL Trace) to monitor
" 3. Analyze execution plan
```

### **Internal Table Processing**
```abap
DATA: lt_materials TYPE TABLE OF mara,
      ls_material  TYPE mara.

SELECT * FROM mara INTO TABLE lt_materials UP TO 100 ROWS.

BREAK-POINT.  " Inspect table content and size

LOOP AT lt_materials INTO ls_material.
  " Process logic
  IF ls_material-mtart = 'FERT'.
    BREAK-POINT.  " Debug specific conditions
  ENDIF.
ENDLOOP.

BREAK-POINT.  " Check final results
```

### **Exception Handling**
```abap
TRY.
    DATA(lv_result) = 10 / 0.
    
  CATCH cx_sy_zerodivide INTO DATA(lx_error).
    BREAK-POINT.  " Debug exception details
    " Inspect: lx_error->get_text()
    "          lx_error->get_longtext()
    
  CATCH cx_root INTO DATA(lx_root).
    BREAK-POINT.  " Debug unexpected exceptions
    " Check exception hierarchy and details
ENDTRY.
```

### **Object-Oriented Debugging**
```abap
CLASS zcl_debug_example DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS: constructor
      IMPORTING iv_param TYPE string,
             process_data
      RETURNING VALUE(rv_result) TYPE string.
  PRIVATE SECTION.
    DATA: mv_internal_data TYPE string.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS zcl_debug_example IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD constructor.
    BREAK-POINT.  " Debug object instantiation
    mv_internal_data = iv_param.
  ENDMETHOD.
  
  METHOD process_data.
    BREAK-POINT.  " Debug method entry
    " Check object state: mv_internal_data
    rv_result = |Processed: { mv_internal_data }|.
    BREAK-POINT.  " Debug before return
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
```

## üéØ **3. Debugger Navigation & Controls**

### **Keyboard Shortcuts**
| **Key** | **Action** | **Description** |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| **F5** | Single Step | Execute current line |
| **F6** | Execute | Execute current statement block |
| **F7** | Return | Return from subroutine/method |
| **F8** | Continue | Continue to next breakpoint |
| **Shift+F12** | Terminate | Stop debugging session |
| **Ctrl+F2** | Set/Remove Breakpoint | Toggle breakpoint |
| **Ctrl+Shift+F5** | Run to Cursor | Execute until cursor position |

### **Debugger Windows**
- **Variables**: View and modify variable values
- **Call Stack**: See program execution path
- **Breakpoints**: Manage all breakpoints
- **Watchpoints**: Monitor variable changes
- **Memory**: Inspect memory allocation

### **Variable Inspection Techniques**
```abap
" In debugger, you can:
" 1. Double-click variable to change value
" 2. Use 'Fields' tab to see all variables
" 3. Use 'Tables' tab for internal tables
" 4. Use 'Objects' tab for object references

DATA: lv_counter TYPE i VALUE 5,
      lt_data TYPE TABLE OF string,
      lo_object TYPE REF TO cl_some_class.

BREAK-POINT.
" Inspect each variable type differently:
" - lv_counter: Simple value inspection
" - lt_data: Table content and structure
" - lo_object: Object state and methods
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **4. Advanced Debugging Tools**

### **Runtime Analysis (SAT)**
```abap
" Transaction: SAT
" Purpose: Performance measurement and analysis

" Usage:
" 1. Go to transaction SAT
" 2. Enter program/transaction to measure
" 3. Execute with measurement active
" 4. Analyze runtime statistics
" 5. Identify performance bottlenecks

" Example: Debug performance issue
REPORT z_performance_debug.
START-OF-SELECTION.
  " Heavy processing code
  SELECT * FROM mara INTO TABLE DATA(lt_materials).
  
  LOOP AT lt_materials INTO DATA(ls_material).
    " Time-consuming operations
  ENDLOOP.
```

### **SQL Trace (ST05)**
```abap
" Transaction: ST05
" Purpose: Database operation analysis

" Usage:
" 1. Go to ST05
" 2. Turn on SQL trace
" 3. Execute program
" 4. Turn off trace
" 5. Display trace results
" 6. Analyze database calls

" What to look for:
" - Number of SELECT statements
" - Execution time
" - Records fetched
" - Database buffer usage
```

### **ABAP Call Monitor (SCMON)**
```abap
" Transaction: SCMON
" Purpose: Monitor ABAP call statistics
" Use for: Production performance analysis
```

### **System Log Analysis (SM21)**
```abap
" Transaction: SM21
" Purpose: System error and message analysis
" Use for: Production issue investigation
```

---

## üéØ **5. Production Debugging Strategies**

### **Safe Production Debugging**
```abap
" Method 1: Conditional debugging with safety checks
IF sy-mandt = '100' AND sy-uname = 'DEVELOPER'.
  BREAK-POINT.
ENDIF.

" Method 2: Use application logging instead
MESSAGE i001(z_custom) WITH 'Debug checkpoint:' lv_variable.

" Method 3: Write to application log
CALL FUNCTION 'BAL_LOG_CREATE'
  EXPORTING
    i_s_log = VALUE bal_s_log( 
      aldate = sy-datum
      altime = sy-uzeit
      aluser = sy-uname
      alprog = sy-repid )
  IMPORTING
    e_log_handle = DATA(lv_log_handle).
```

### **Remote Debugging**
```abap
" For RFC and external calls
" 1. SE80 ‚Üí Utilities ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí ABAP Editor ‚Üí Debugging
" 2. Check "External Debugging"
" 3. Set breakpoints before RFC call
" 4. Use H_EXTERNAL for HTTP debugging

" Example: Debug RFC call
CALL FUNCTION 'REMOTE_FUNCTION'
  DESTINATION 'TARGET_SYSTEM'
  EXPORTING
    input_param = lv_input
  IMPORTING
    output_param = lv_output
  EXCEPTIONS
    system_failure = 1
    communication_failure = 2.

BREAK-POINT.  " Check sy-subrc and output
```

### **Background Job Debugging**
```abap
" For batch processes
" 1. Use SM37 to monitor job
" 2. Job ‚Üí Spool ‚Üí Display spool
" 3. Use conditional breakpoints with user checks

" Example: Debug background processing
IF sy-batch = 'X'.
  " Background job specific logic
  MESSAGE i001(z_custom) WITH 'Background processing checkpoint'.
ELSE.
  " Interactive debugging
  BREAK-POINT.
ENDIF.
```

## üéØ **6. Memory and Performance Debugging**

### **Memory Analysis**
```abap
" Debug memory consumption
DATA: lr_data TYPE REF TO data,
      lv_memory_before TYPE i,
      lv_memory_after TYPE i.

FIELD-SYMBOLS: <lt_table> TYPE STANDARD TABLE.

" Check memory before allocation
CALL FUNCTION 'SYSTEM_RESET_RUNTIMES'.
lv_memory_before = cl_abap_memory_utilities=>get_total_used_size( ).

CREATE DATA lr_data TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF mara.
ASSIGN lr_data->* TO <lt_table>.

SELECT * FROM mara INTO TABLE <lt_table>.

lv_memory_after = cl_abap_memory_utilities=>get_total_used_size( ).

BREAK-POINT.  " Analyze memory usage difference
```

### **Performance Bottleneck Detection**
```abap
" Use GET RUN TIME for precise timing
DATA: lv_start_time TYPE i,
      lv_end_time TYPE i,
      lv_duration TYPE i.

GET RUN TIME FIELD lv_start_time.

" Code section to measure
SELECT * FROM large_table INTO TABLE DATA(lt_data)
  WHERE some_field = some_value.

GET RUN TIME FIELD lv_end_time.
lv_duration = lv_end_time - lv_start_time.

BREAK-POINT.  " Check duration in microseconds
```

## üéØ **7. Debugging Best Practices**

### **Before Debugging**
```abap
" ‚úÖ DO's:
" 1. Understand business requirement
" 2. Review program documentation
" 3. Prepare test data
" 4. Identify suspicious code areas

" Example preparation:
" - Check transport history
" - Review recent changes
" - Understand data flow
" - Prepare debug scenarios
```

### **During Debugging**
```abap
" ‚úÖ Effective debugging approach:
" 1. Start with external breakpoints
" 2. Check sy-subrc after database operations
" 3. Verify variable values at key points
" 4. Use step-through for complex logic

" Example systematic debugging:
SELECT SINGLE * FROM mara INTO DATA(ls_material)
  WHERE matnr = p_matnr.

BREAK-POINT.  " Check: sy-subrc, ls_material content

IF sy-subrc = 0.
  " Process material
  BREAK-POINT.  " Verify processing logic
ELSE.
  " Handle not found
  BREAK-POINT.  " Check error handling
ENDIF.
```

### **After Debugging**
```abap
" ‚úÖ Cleanup and documentation:
" 1. Remove all breakpoints
" 2. Clean up debug code
" 3. Document the issue and solution
" 4. Update code comments

" ‚ùå Never leave in production:
BREAK-POINT.              " Remove this
WRITE: 'Debug output'.     " Remove debug output
MESSAGE i001 WITH 'Test'.  " Remove test messages
```

## üéØ **8. Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Database Issues**
```abap
" Problem: SELECT returns no data
SELECT SINGLE * FROM mara INTO DATA(ls_material)
  WHERE matnr = p_matnr.

BREAK-POINT.
" Debug checklist:
" 1. Check sy-subrc (0 = found, 4 = not found)
" 2. Verify p_matnr value and format
" 3. Check table data directly (SE16)
" 4. Verify WHERE clause conditions
" 5. Check authorizations
```

### **Loop Issues**
```abap
DATA: lt_materials TYPE TABLE OF mara,
      lv_count TYPE i.

SELECT * FROM mara INTO TABLE lt_materials.

LOOP AT lt_materials INTO DATA(ls_material).
  lv_count = lv_count + 1.
  
  " Debug infinite loop prevention
  IF lv_count > 1000.
    BREAK-POINT.  " Investigation point
    EXIT.
  ENDIF.
  
  " Process logic
ENDLOOP.

BREAK-POINT.  " Check final count and results
```

### **Exception Issues**
```abap
" Debug unhandled exceptions
TRY.
    " Risky operation
    DATA(lv_result) = lv_numerator / lv_denominator.
    
  CATCH cx_sy_zerodivide.
    BREAK-POINT.  " Debug division by zero
    
  CATCH cx_sy_arithmetic_error.
    BREAK-POINT.  " Debug arithmetic errors
    
  CATCH cx_root INTO DATA(lx_error).
    BREAK-POINT.  " Debug unexpected exceptions
    " Check: lx_error->get_text()
ENDTRY.
```

## üéØ **9. Integration with Development Workflow**

### **Transport Debugging**
```abap
" Debug transport-related issues
" 1. Use SE09/SE10 to check transport status
" 2. Verify object versions across systems
" 3. Check for incomplete transports
" 4. Debug activation issues in target system
```

### **Unit Testing Integration**
```abap
" Debug unit tests
CLASS ltcl_test DEFINITION FOR TESTING.
  PRIVATE SECTION.
    METHODS: test_calculation FOR TESTING.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS ltcl_test IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD test_calculation.
    DATA(lo_calc) = NEW zcl_calculator( ).
    
    BREAK-POINT.  " Debug test setup
    
    DATA(lv_result) = lo_calc->add( iv_a = 5 iv_b = 3 ).
    
    BREAK-POINT.  " Debug test execution
    
    cl_abap_unit_assert=>assert_equals(
      act = lv_result
      exp = 8
      msg = 'Addition failed' ).
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
```
