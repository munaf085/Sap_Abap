## 🔍 **Potential Gaps Analysis**

### **❓ AREAS TO DOUBLE-CHECK:**

#### **1. Modern SAP Technologies (Important for 2024+)**
**Question Coverage:** Moderate
**For 4+ years experience, you might face:**

```abap
" Modern ABAP syntax (7.40+)
DATA(lt_result) = VALUE string_table( 
  FOR ls_item IN lt_source 
  WHERE ( status = 'ACTIVE' )
  ( |{ ls_item-id }: { ls_item-name }| ) ).

" CDS Views knowledge
@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'ZSALES_VIEW'
@AbapCatalog.compiler.compareFilter: true
define view Z_SALES_ANALYTICS as select from vbak {
  key vbeln,
  kunnr,
  netwr,
  erdat
}

" RESTful Application Programming (RAP)
@EndUserText.label: 'Sales Order Management'
define behavior for Z_SALES_ORDER {
  use create;
  use update;
  use delete;
}
```

#### **2. SAP Fiori/UI5 Integration**
**Question Coverage:** Basic
**Common Interview Questions:**
- "How do you expose ABAP data to Fiori applications?"
- "Explain OData service development"
- "What's the difference between Gateway and embedded gateway?"

#### **3. S/4HANA Specific Knowledge**
**Question Coverage:** Good in scenarios
**Key Topics:**
- Core Data Services (CDS)
- ABAP Managed Database Procedures (AMDP)
- Business Object Processing Framework (BOPF)
- Key User Extensibility

## 🚀 **Quick Addition: Missing Critical Questions**

### **❗ HIGH-PRIORITY ADDITIONS FOR 4+ YEARS EXPERIENCE:**

#### **Q: How do you create and consume OData services in ABAP?**
**Why Critical:** Essential for Fiori integration
**Sample Answer:**
```abap
" 1. Create OData service using SEGW
" 2. Define entity types and entity sets
" 3. Implement CRUD operations in DPC class

CLASS zcl_odata_dpc_ext DEFINITION INHERITING FROM zcl_odata_dpc.
  PROTECTED SECTION.
    METHODS: salesorderset_get_entityset REDEFINITION,
             salesorderset_create_entity REDEFINITION.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS zcl_odata_dpc_ext IMPLEMENTATION.
  METHOD salesorderset_get_entityset.
    " Implement GET operation
    SELECT vbeln, kunnr, netwr FROM vbak
      INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE et_entityset
      WHERE kunnr = iv_customer.
  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
```

#### **Q: Explain CDS Views and their advantages**
**Why Critical:** Core S/4HANA technology
**Sample Answer:**
```sql
@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'ZSALESANALYSIS'
@AbapCatalog.compiler.compareFilter: true
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #CHECK
@EndUserText.label: 'Sales Analysis'

define view Z_Sales_Analysis as select from vbak as header
  inner join vbap as item on header.vbeln = item.vbeln
  association [1..1] to kna1 as _Customer on header.kunnr = _Customer.kunnr
{
  key header.vbeln,
  header.kunnr,
  header.netwr as header_value,
  sum(item.netwr) as total_item_value,
  _Customer.name1 as customer_name
}
group by header.vbeln, header.kunnr, header.netwr, _Customer.name1
```

#### **Q: How do you handle authorization in modern ABAP development?**
**Why Critical:** Security is paramount
**Sample Answer:**
```abap
" DCL (Data Control Language) for CDS Views
@EndUserText.label: 'Sales Order Authorization'
@MappingRole: true
define role Z_SALES_ORDER_AUTH {
  grant select on Z_Sales_Analysis
    where (SalesOrg) = aspect pfcg_auth(V_VBAK_VKO, VKORG, ACTVT = '03');
}

" Traditional authorization check
AUTHORITY-CHECK OBJECT 'V_VBAK_VKO'
  ID 'VKORG' FIELD lv_sales_org
  ID 'VTWEG' FIELD lv_dist_channel
  ID 'SPART' FIELD lv_division
  ID 'ACTVT' FIELD '03'.
```

#### **Q: Describe your experience with SAP Gateway and REST services**
**Why Critical:** Integration expertise expected
**Sample Answer:**
```abap
" REST service consumption using cl_http_client
DATA: lo_client TYPE REF TO if_http_client,
      lv_json   TYPE string.

cl_http_client=>create_by_url(
  EXPORTING url = 'https://api.external-system.com/customers'
  IMPORTING client = lo_client ).

lo_client->request->set_method( if_http_request=>co_request_method_get ).
lo_client->request->set_header_field( 
  name = 'Authorization' 
  value = 'Bearer xyz123' ).

lo_client->send( ).
lo_client->receive( ).

lv_json = lo_client->response->get_cdata( ).
```
