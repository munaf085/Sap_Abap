### **Internal Tables (Asked in 85%+ interviews)**

#### ‚≠ê‚≠ê Q6: What are the different types of internal tables?
**Why asked:** Core ABAP concept
**Answer:**
```abap
" STANDARD TABLE - Index-based, allows duplicates
DATA: lt_standard TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF mara.

" SORTED TABLE - Automatically sorted, unique/non-unique keys
DATA: lt_sorted TYPE SORTED TABLE OF mara WITH UNIQUE KEY matnr.

" HASHED TABLE - Hash-based access, must have unique key
DATA: lt_hashed TYPE HASHED TABLE OF mara WITH UNIQUE KEY matnr.
```

#### ‚≠ê‚≠ê Q7: How do you read data from internal tables?
**Why asked:** Practical coding knowledge
**Answer:**
```abap
" READ TABLE with index
READ TABLE lt_table INTO ls_structure INDEX 1.

" READ TABLE with key
READ TABLE lt_table INTO ls_structure WITH KEY matnr = 'MAT001'.

" READ TABLE with field symbol (better performance)
READ TABLE lt_table ASSIGNING <fs_structure> WITH KEY matnr = 'MAT001'.

  " Record found
ENDIF.
```

#### ‚≠ê‚≠ê Q8: What is the difference between APPEND and INSERT?
**Why asked:** Very common basic question
**Answer:**
```abap
" APPEND - Adds at end (only for standard tables)
APPEND ls_structure TO lt_table.

" INSERT - Adds at specific position or maintains sorting
INSERT ls_structure INTO lt_table INDEX 1.
INSERT ls_structure INTO TABLE lt_sorted.  " Maintains sort order
```

    INTO TABLE lt_makt
    FOR ALL ENTRIES IN lt_mara
    WHERE matnr = lt_mara-matnr
      AND spras = sy-langu.
ENDIF.

" Limitations:
" 1. Driver table must not be empty
" 2. Can cause performance issues with large tables
" 3. Duplicates in driver table create multiple identical queries
```

**Answer:**
```abap
" SELECT SINGLE - Gets maximum one record
SELECT SINGLE matnr, mtart FROM mara INTO (lv_matnr, lv_mtart)
  WHERE matnr = 'MAT001'.

" SELECT - Gets multiple records
SELECT matnr, mtart FROM mara INTO TABLE lt_mara
  WHERE mtart = 'FERT'.
```

#### ‚≠ê‚≠ê Q11: How do you optimize database SELECT statements?

**Answer:**
- Use specific WHERE clauses
- Select only required fields (avoid SELECT *)
- Use database indexes effectively
- Use JOINs instead of nested SELECTs
- Use FOR ALL ENTRIES properly
- Use PACKAGE SIZE for large datasets

### **Performance Optimization (Asked in 75%+ interviews)**

#### ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Q15: How do you improve ABAP performance?
**Why asked:** Critical for production systems
**Answer:**
1. **Database Level:**
   - Use proper WHERE clauses
   - Select only required fields
   - Use database indexes
   - Avoid nested SELECT statements

2. **Internal Table Level:**
   - Use appropriate table types (HASHED for lookups)

   - Avoid string concatenation in loops

#### ‚≠ê‚≠ê Q16: When would you use HASHED table vs SORTED table?
**Why asked:** Performance optimization
**Answer:**
```abap
" HASHED - Best for key-based access, no sorting needed
DATA: lt_lookup TYPE HASHED TABLE OF customer WITH UNIQUE KEY id.

" SORTED - When you need both fast access AND sorting
DATA: lt_sorted TYPE SORTED TABLE OF customer WITH UNIQUE KEY id.
