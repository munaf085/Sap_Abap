## 2. What is ABAP?

### Definition
**ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming)** is SAP's proprietary programming language used for developing applications within the SAP environment.

### Key Characteristics:
- **High-level language** - Easy to learn and understand
- **Database independent** - Works with various database systems
- **Report-oriented** - Excellent for data processing and reporting
- **Object-oriented** - Supports OOP concepts (since version 4.0)
- **Unicode compliant** - Supports international characters

### ABAP Evolution:
```
ABAP/4 (1990s) ‚Üí ABAP Objects (2000s) ‚Üí ABAP 7.5+ (2010s) ‚Üí ABAP for Cloud (2020s)
```

### Why Learn ABAP?
- High demand in the job market
- Excellent career prospects
- Good salary packages
- Work with enterprise-level applications

## 3. SAP System Architecture

### Three-Tier Architecture

#### 1. **Presentation Layer (GUI)**
- **SAP GUI** - Traditional desktop interface
- **SAP Fiori** - Modern web-based interface
- **Web Browser** - For web-based applications

#### 2. **Application Layer**
- **Application Server** - Processes business logic
- **ABAP Runtime** - Executes ABAP programs
- **Work Processes** - Handle user requests

#### 3. **Database Layer**
- **Database Server** - Stores all data
- **Supported Databases**: HANA, Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, etc.

### SAP Landscape
```
Development System (DEV) ‚Üí Quality System (QAS) ‚Üí Production System (PRD)
```

### Client Concept
- Each SAP system can have multiple **clients**
- Client = isolated business environment
- Typical clients: 000 (Admin), 100 (Training), 200 (Development)

## 4. ABAP Development Environment

### SAP NetWeaver Developer Studio vs SE80

#### **SE80 - ABAP Workbench (Traditional)**
- Integrated development environment
- Repository browser
- ABAP Editor
- Screen Painter
- Menu Painter

#### **ADT - ABAP Development Tools (Modern)**
- Eclipse-based IDE
- Modern editing features
- Git integration
- Better debugging capabilities

### Key Development Transactions:
| Transaction | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **SE80** | ABAP Workbench |
| **SE38** | ABAP Editor |
| **SE11** | ABAP Dictionary |
| **SE91** | Message Maintenance |
| **SM30** | Table Maintenance |
| **SE93** | Transaction Code Maintenance |

## 5. Your First ABAP Program

### Program Structure
```abap
*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
*& Report ZHELLO_WORLD
*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*
*& Purpose: My first ABAP program
*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*

REPORT zhello_world.

* This is a comment
" This is also a comment

START-OF-SELECTION.
  WRITE: 'Hello, World!'.
  WRITE: / 'Welcome to ABAP Programming'.
  WRITE: / 'Today is', sy-datum.
```

### Basic ABAP Syntax Rules:
- Programs start with `REPORT` statement
- Statements end with period (.)
- Case-insensitive (but follow conventions)
- Use meaningful names
- Comments start with * or "

### ABAP Naming Conventions:
- **Customer objects** start with **Z** or **Y**
- **Programs**: ZREPORT_NAME or YREPORT_NAME
- **Variables**: Use descriptive names
- **Constants**: Use uppercase

### System Variables (SY-Fields):
```abap
SY-DATUM  " Current date
SY-UZEIT  " Current time
SY-UNAME  " Current user
SY-TCODE  " Current transaction code
SY-SUBRC  " Return code (0 = success)
```

## 6. Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Create Your First Program
**Objective**: Create a simple ABAP program that displays system information.

**Steps**:
1. Go to SE38
2. Create program `ZSYSTEM_INFO`
3. Write code to display:
   - Current date
   - Current time
   - Your username
   - Current client

**Solution**:
```abap
REPORT zsystem_info.

START-OF-SELECTION.
  WRITE: 'System Information Report'.
  WRITE: / '========================'.
  WRITE: / 'Current Date:', sy-datum.
  WRITE: / 'Current Time:', sy-uzeit.
  WRITE: / 'User Name:', sy-uname.
  WRITE: / 'Client:', sy-mandt.
```

### Exercise 2: Basic Calculations
**Objective**: Create a program that performs basic mathematical operations.

```abap
REPORT zcalculator.

DATA: num1 TYPE i VALUE 10,
      num2 TYPE i VALUE 5,
      result TYPE i.

START-OF-SELECTION.
  WRITE: 'Basic Calculator'.
  WRITE: / '================'.
  
  result = num1 + num2.
  WRITE: / 'Addition:', num1, '+', num2, '=', result.
  
  result = num1 - num2.
  WRITE: / 'Subtraction:', num1, '-', num2, '=', result.
  
  result = num1 * num2.
  WRITE: / 'Multiplication:', num1, '*', num2, '=', result.
  
  result = num1 / num2.
  WRITE: / 'Division:', num1, '/', num2, '=', result.
```
